<strong><u>QUESTIONS</u></strong>

<ol>
<li>Write a program to find the adjacency list of a given directed graph G which is represented as adjacency matrix.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Input Format:</strong>

<ul>
<li>The first line of the input contains a positive integer n, the number of vertices in the graph, in the range 1 to 1000.</li>
<li>The next line represents the Adjacency matrix representation of the given graph. <strong>Output Format:</strong></li>
<li>The first n lines contain the adjacency list of each node in ascending order. Each line contains the label of the respective node followed by the nodes adjacent to it sorted in ascending order from left to right separated by a space. If a node has no adjacent nodes, then the line corresponding to its adjacency list will contain the label of that node only.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Note: </strong>In a graph with n vertices, the vertices are labeled from 0 to n — 1.

<ol start="2">
<li>Write programs to compute the minimum spanning tree of a connected undirected graph G using the following algorithms:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Kruskal’s algorithm</li>
<li>Prim’s algorithm</li>
</ul>
<strong>Input Format:</strong>

<ul>
<li>First line contains a character from { ‘a’, `131:</li>
<li>If the input character is ‘a’ then compute the minimum spanning tree using Kruskal’s algorithm</li>
<li>Else if the character is 93′ compute the minimum spanning tree using Prim’s algorithm</li>
<li>Second line contains an integer n E [1, 1000], that denotes the number of vertices in the graph.</li>
<li>The subsequent <em>Ti </em>lines contain the label of the respective node followed by the nodes adjacent to it sorted in ascending order from left to right separated by a space.</li>
<li>The subsequent n lines contain label of the respective node followed by the weights of the edges corresponding to the adjacency list separated by a space. The edge weights are real numbers in the range [40000, 10000]. Further, no two edges have the same weight.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Output Format:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Single line containing the sum of the edge weights of the minimum spanning tree.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<strong>Note: </strong>In a graph with n vertices, the vertices are labeled from 0 to n — 1. Use adjacency lists to store the graphs, with the vertices sorted in ascending order. The adjacency list of each node is a singly linked list that contains its adjacent nodes sorted in ascending order from left to right. The nodes in this list contain two fields, namely, the label of the adjacent node and the weight of the edge, if provided. Unless specified otherwise, the adjacency lists must be processed iteratively from left to right.

<strong>NOTE: </strong>In order to print the root list of a fibonacci heap, the root list is traversed in the <strong>right </strong><strong>direction </strong>starting from the minimum node, where the root list is implemented as a circular doubly linked list.

<ol start="7">
<li>Write a program that implements the DISJOINT-SET data structure using rooted forests. Also,write functions to implement the ranked union and path compression heuristics on your data structure, and compute the efficiency of the disjoint set data structure find operation by applying neither, either or both of the heuristics, by counting the total number of data accesses performed over the course of the program. Your program must support the following functions:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>MAKESET(X) – creates a singleton set with element x.</li>
<li>FIND(x) – finds the representative of the set containing the element x.</li>
<li>UNION(X,Y) – merges the sets containing elements x and y into a single set. The representative of the resultant set is assigned with find(x), unless the ranked union heuristic is used and the ranks of both find(x) and find(y) are different. Otherwise, the representative is assigned in accordance with the ranked union heuristic.</li>
<li>Note that looking up an element in the data structure must be done in 0(1) time. <strong>Input Format:</strong></li>
<li>The input consists of multiple lines, each one containing a character from I’m’, ‘f’, `u’, ‘s’l

followed by zero, one or two integers. The integer(s), if given, is in the range 0 to 10000.</li>
<li>Call the function makeset(x) if the input line contains the character ‘m’ followed by an

integer x . Print -1 if x is already present in some set, and the value of x, otherwise.</li>
<li>Call the function find(x) if the input line contains the character ‘f’ followed by an integer Output the value of find(x) if x is found, and -1, otherwise.</li>
<li>Call the function union(x,y) if the input line contains the character ‘u’ followed by space separated integers x and y . Print -1, without terminating, if either x or y isn’t present in the disjoint set. Print find(x) itself if find(x)=find(y) . Otherwise, print the representative of the resultant set. The representative of the resultant set is assigned with find(x), unless the ranked union heuristic is used and the ranks of both find(x) and find(y) are different. Otherwise, the representative is assigned in accordance with the ranked union heuristic.</li>
<li>If the input line contains the character ‘s’, print the number of data accesses performed by the find commands by each of the data structures over the course of the program and</li>

<strong>Output Format:</strong>

<ul>
<li>The output consists of multiple lines of space-separated columns. The columns correspond to the following disjoint-set data structures:</li>

<li>with neither ranked union nor path compression applied.</li>
<li>with only ranked union applied.</li>
